TO Do List

Program your scraper to check for a folder called ‘data’. If the folder doesn’t exist, the scraper should create one. If the folder does exist, the scraper should do nothing.

If your program is run twice, it should overwrite the data in the CSV file with the updated information.

If http://shirts4mike.com is down, an error message describing the issue should appear in the console.
The error should be human-friendly, such as “There’s been a 404 error. Cannot connect to the to http://shirts4mike.com.”
To test and make sure the error message displays as expected, you can disable the wifi on your computer or device.

EXCEEDS

Edit your package.json file so that your program runs when the npm start command is run.

When an error occurs, log it to a file named scraper-error.log . It should append to the bottom of the file with a time stamp and error e.g. [Tue Feb 16 2016 10:02:12 GMT-0800 (PST)] <error message>
